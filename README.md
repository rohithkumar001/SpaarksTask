Spaarks Task final


I have taken the liberty to fidget around with the required interface 

Download the file as zip from https://github.com/rohithkumar001/SpaarksTask

extract the files into any folder.

fire up(start) your terminal and if your using windows, go to the folder's location by using the cd command

in the terminal go the location where package.json is present and use the command "npm i"

you can use 'npm install --force' to overcome dependency conflict, if any. some features dont work if we change the dependancy, so its better to not edit the package.json file.

now install angular cli if you don't already have it on your pc.

type this command npm i -g @angular/cli

now type "ng serve -o" in your terminal . it will run your application and deploy it on localhost:4200. adding -o to ng serve will automatically open local host for you in your default browser.
